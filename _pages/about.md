My name is Jan. I am a postdoctoral researcher in the field of climate science. After my Master's graduation in Physics in 2016, I did a PhD in Geography which I finished in 2020. I consider myself a trans-disciplinary Earth system scientist with a special interest in everything related to Earth's cryosphere. I am truly fascinated by the changes that the climate on Earth has undergone in the past, and at the same time, I am deeply concerned about those changes in climate that are happening right now and in the near future. Besides the physical principles of the Earth system, I am also fascinated by its "human component" and how social dynamics interact with natural processes. With my research, I hope to contribute a small piece of understanding to the manifold puzzles of the Earth system of which I am a tiny piece myself.

For my research, I have been using various methodological approaches including exploratory and statistical data analysis, dynamical systems theory, field work and field measurements, remote sensing, and last but not least numerical modelling of different complexities. While I see great benefits in the combined use of multiple methodological approaches to tackle (geo-)scientific questions, my strength lies in the abstraction, conceptualization, and creative model-building of physical processes.
